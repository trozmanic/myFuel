## Disclamer
I couln't complete the App monetization part of the asignment due to an issue with Google Admob. The platform didn't alow me to register the app so I could setup testing. The issue started in the very begining, I hope that this will not be a determaning factor. I still added the code for adds but is commented out so the app works, I however could not test any of the add features and may not work.

## Questions
1. They should be complementary to the apps content and shouldn't interfere with the flow of the app. But should  rather be placed them in spots wher ther is not as much interaction.
2. You could implment an external service(API) that alows the owner to control when adds are served and under what conditions, you could also send back apps data and decide under this new conditions if it a good idea to serve adds.
3. Again a service for monitoring user interaction, you could perform tests (2 groups, test and control, the test group would get new adds control would not) and assess if adds negativly impact on the user experience.
